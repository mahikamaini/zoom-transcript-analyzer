00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.250
David Dobervich (he/him): Okay,

2
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.870
really,

3
00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.999
Bradley Scholten: how's it going? How do you feel?

4
00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:32.590
Bradley Scholten: I feel fine like still, not like a little bit of like cold symptoms, you know, like a little bit of coughing, stuffy nose. But I feel like good like,

5
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.780
Bradley Scholten: and just gotta wait for a test or

6
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:44.039
Bradley Scholten: Monday like after ten days, even if you are testing positive. They say you have to come back to work anyways. So too long.

7
00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.190
David Dobervich (he/him): And just like, okay,

8
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.800
David Dobervich (he/him): cool.

9
00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.830
David Dobervich (he/him): Here's a

10
00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.970
David Dobervich (he/him): Here's what we did during Halloween.

11
00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.129
Bradley Scholten: Whoa! That's a big tree,

12
00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.020
David Dobervich (he/him): very cool, like stuff hanging from the ceiling.

13
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.279
Bradley Scholten: Very nice. Yeah.

14
00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:14.760
David Dobervich (he/him): So I just uh making the slides for today. I am uploading the video from yesterday.

15
00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.370
David Dobervich (he/him): Um, what's next in the grand scheme

16
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.420
Bradley Scholten: in the grand scheme? Um.

17
00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.680
Bradley Scholten: Let's see here, plop in the calendar

18
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.180
Bradley Scholten: all right um

19
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.680
Bradley Scholten: in the grand scheme. So I

20
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.460
Bradley Scholten: something still messed up with this video. Sorry, is it?

21
00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:50.120
David Dobervich (he/him): Yeah, I wonder if it only partially uploaded? What's the file size on your hard drive.

22
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:57.989
Bradley Scholten: Oh, it does. Still saying it's uploading right now. It says sixty. One uploaded. That's weird. Because yesterday it said it was fully uploaded.

23
00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.960
Bradley Scholten: Hmm.

24
00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:07.899
Bradley Scholten: I'll check on it in a moment to see if it changes from sixty. One. Oh, there it just moved to sixty, two, so

25
00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:15.999
Bradley Scholten: I guess I Let's just wait, and i'll do it at the end. Yeah, I guess it's taken four K: That must be why it's taking so long.

26
00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.470
Bradley Scholten: Um!

27
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.619
Bradley Scholten: So I skipped a a probability lesson.

28
00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.200
Bradley Scholten: Um,

29
00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.150
Bradley Scholten: and I think I need to go back to it, which is going to be just sort of showing them the

30
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:40.460
Bradley Scholten: the conditional probability thing like when you rearrange it, you get the the general multiplication rule, which again, they already sort of knew about like

31
00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.370
Bradley Scholten: um. But then having some practice with that, and probably some general practice.

32
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:46.670
David Dobervich (he/him): Okay,

33
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:52.529
Bradley Scholten: Um. So the only other thing next week is to talk about completely randomized design.

34
00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.300
David Dobervich (he/him): Oh, great.

35
00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:57.609
David Dobervich (he/him): Oh, cause it's.

36
00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:08.580
Bradley Scholten: But we have no Friday next week.

37
00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.759
Bradley Scholten: Hmm. Hold on. Let me think about this here.

38
00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:21.059
Bradley Scholten: Yeah, because we pushed some things around, and I didn't realize I forgot about that.

39
00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:25.710
Bradley Scholten: Okay,

40
00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:31.850
Bradley Scholten: Mhm.

41
00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:33.270
Bradley Scholten: Um.

42
00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.669
Then, yeah, we should.

43
00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.549
Bradley Scholten: We should do something on that day with a probability lesson

44
00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:54.669
Bradley Scholten: number nine and ten down here. No, It's B. A. B. A:

45
00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.850
David Dobervich (he/him): That's pretty irritating,

46
00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.600
Bradley Scholten: very irritating.

47
00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.119
Bradley Scholten: Um. And then

48
00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.370
Bradley Scholten: okay, Well, that means Monday. Tuesday. Oh, shoot, Okay,

49
00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.829
Bradley Scholten: That means we need video and video notes for next week.

50
00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.590
Bradley Scholten: Shoot

51
00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:22.090
Bradley Scholten: like to hand out next class

52
00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:29.160
Bradley Scholten: um, And it's about completely randomized design.

53
00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:34.569
David Dobervich (he/him): So the good news is that's probably pretty fast to put together.

54
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.040
David Dobervich (he/him): Is your next class tomorrow?

55
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:40.470
Bradley Scholten: Yeah,

56
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.670
David Dobervich (he/him): Yeah, that's irritating. Okay? Uh:

57
00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:50.490
David Dobervich (he/him): because the problem is like I could probably do it during first block tomorrow, or maybe I could even do it before first block tomorrow.

58
00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:53.349
Bradley Scholten: I mean, that would be

59
00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.810
Bradley Scholten: fine,

60
00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:56.940
Bradley Scholten: because

61
00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.699
Bradley Scholten: if i'm not there,

62
00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:07.379
Bradley Scholten: then they would probably only watch the video like during the last half hour of class.

63
00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:09.200
Bradley Scholten: Um!

64
00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:14.230
Bradley Scholten: And then, if I was there, then it would just be for homework. And so it doesn't need to be ready

65
00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:16.610
Bradley Scholten: actually during that time.

66
00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.940
Bradley Scholten: So if you think you could pull something together

67
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:32.399
Bradley Scholten: real fast on that, otherwise we could always just go with just pulling coning's video over and using his notes for last year,

68
00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:46.319
David Dobervich (he/him): because a lot of it is. Repeat from my original video, plus a couple of extra things like blinding

69
00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.360
David Dobervich (he/him): placebo.

70
00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:55.109
David Dobervich (he/him): And then like being clear about how you write up your procedure

71
00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:00.520
David Dobervich (he/him): factor, response levels, treatments, et cetera.

72
00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:01.760
Bradley Scholten: Yeah,

73
00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:05.960
Bradley Scholten: Um.

74
00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:07.820
Bradley Scholten: Cool.

75
00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.380
Bradley Scholten: Alright.

76
00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:14.460
Bradley Scholten: Just just things here.

77
00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:31.120
Bradley Scholten: Okay,

78
00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:33.310
Bradley Scholten: Um:

79
00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:35.780
Bradley Scholten: Okay.

80
00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:39.670
Bradley Scholten: So that sounds good. And

81
00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:48.309
Bradley Scholten: what is coning thing from last year with regard to that, Is that good enough for us.

82
00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:59.229
David Dobervich (he/him): Wait! What's this other end? Oh, Rams block design

83
00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:08.609
Bradley Scholten: is the Sashini chairman Still Good.

84
00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:12.060
Bradley Scholten: I mean, I think it's acceptable.

85
00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:20.109
David Dobervich (he/him): Yeah, let's see that

86
00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.220
Bradley Scholten: Okay,

87
00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:22.940
Bradley Scholten: Um,

88
00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:26.700
Bradley Scholten: um. Keep forgetting to to ask

89
00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:36.410
Bradley Scholten: which is, you know, students asked a lot last year, and then I had the same question, and I think you had the same question, What is the difference between a factor and a level?

90
00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.429
Bradley Scholten: Yeah. Good question. I was going to try and decide

91
00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:43.519
David Dobervich (he/him): before I made the notes. Um,

92
00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:52.939
Bradley Scholten: It sort of seems like Factor is possibly like the big umbrella term,

93
00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:58.600
Bradley Scholten: and like level is like the specifics within that,

94
00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:04.200
Bradley Scholten: because like here, factor is

95
00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:09.660
David Dobervich (he/him): factor is a way of referring to your categorical variable.

96
00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.949
David Dobervich (he/him): That's your um explanatory variable.

97
00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:19.380
David Dobervich (he/him): And in fact, our levels are the possible values that the factor can take.

98
00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:20.980
Bradley Scholten: Okay,

99
00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:32.939
David Dobervich (he/him): So I will be explicit with this in the notes.

100
00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:34.560
Bradley Scholten: I'm: got

101
00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:37.930
Bradley Scholten: cool.

102
00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:39.720
Bradley Scholten: Um.

103
00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:54.950
Bradley Scholten: And to ask,

104
00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:57.690
Bradley Scholten: Okay,

105
00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:06.800
Bradley Scholten: making new folders and stuff,

106
00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.090
Bradley Scholten: All right? Yeah. The

107
00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:22.970
Bradley Scholten: obviously copies of the the video notes whenever you finish those up and then um the activity for sampling methods,

108
00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:27.710
Bradley Scholten: which was like the farm thing which i'm moving over right now.

109
00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:34.710
David Dobervich (he/him): Okay,

110
00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:07.180
Bradley Scholten: cool,

111
00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.890
Bradley Scholten: All right. Um.

112
00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:12.349
Bradley Scholten: And then

113
00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:19.459
Bradley Scholten: we also need to plan three point five, since there's

114
00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:21.299
Bradley Scholten: just block design.

115
00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:23.920
Bradley Scholten: That's block design. Yeah,

116
00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:27.330
um.

117
00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:30.849
Bradley Scholten: So I guess. Let's look at

118
00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.020
Bradley Scholten: what

119
00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:34.760
Bradley Scholten: Derek did last year

120
00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:39.920
Bradley Scholten: for the notes and see if there's anything in there that

121
00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:42.979
Bradley Scholten: we think really should be changed.

122
00:11:57.930 --> 00:11:59.070
Let's see.

123
00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:06.539
Bradley Scholten: All right. I'm sharing my screen.

124
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:13.559
David Dobervich (he/him): Yeah, I was just looking at that.

125
00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:17.769
David Dobervich (he/him): So anything in you, as usual. Let's just make it

126
00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:20.080
David Dobervich (he/him): like less verbose,

127
00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:25.370
David Dobervich (he/him): and try and like visually organize it a little bit more clearly.

128
00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:29.160
Bradley Scholten: Okay, do you have like?

129
00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:38.229
Bradley Scholten: Do you have like a visual that you're thinking of doing for this next set of videos that we could just sort of go through,

130
00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:42.630
Bradley Scholten: or

131
00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:49.400
Bradley Scholten: I was just trying to think like, should we just like,

132
00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:56.659
Bradley Scholten: you know, If you come up with a visual, then like we'll stick with that since you're the first sort of video for this.

133
00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:02.639
Bradley Scholten: Oh, and um. Another question. Is it your understanding that students either need

134
00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:13.300
Bradley Scholten: like the words like the bullet points up here, or a diagram like below? Not necessarily both. Is that what you understood to or

135
00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:16.210
David Dobervich (he/him): no?

136
00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:23.299
David Dobervich (he/him): I didn't have an understanding. I always said both, but it did seem a little redundant,

137
00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:31.500
David Dobervich (he/him): but, like just having the diagram doesn't Feel like quite enough.

138
00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:32.750
Bradley Scholten: Yeah,

139
00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:37.680
David Dobervich (he/him): because you're not clearly identifying stuff like the factor

140
00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:39.629
David Dobervich (he/him): and the treatments.

141
00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:45.310
David Dobervich (he/him): Is this diagram like a like an Ap. Thing.

142
00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:50.510
Bradley Scholten: Um, I feel like it is. Let me see if I can find

143
00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:53.940
Bradley Scholten: um.

144
00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:58.659
Bradley Scholten: I feel like there was an fr qu of the day sort of thing

145
00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:01.640
Bradley Scholten: that we did.

146
00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:06.399
Bradley Scholten: And when I googled, you know, for the how did it college board

147
00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:08.710
Bradley Scholten: come up with this

148
00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:10.250
Bradley Scholten: that they

149
00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:12.340
Bradley Scholten: I feel like gave like

150
00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:18.269
I thought it could be like one or the other two thousand number five.

151
00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:20.259
Bradley Scholten: So when it's earlier.

152
00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:22.210
Bradley Scholten: Okay,

153
00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:27.069
Bradley Scholten: stats.

154
00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:44.000
Bradley Scholten: Okay,

155
00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:50.220
Bradley Scholten: so describes or gives a detailed diagram,

156
00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:56.339
Bradley Scholten: and in the description

157
00:14:56.890 --> 00:14:58.810
Bradley Scholten: they need.

158
00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:05.470
Bradley Scholten: So this is for just a regular experiment, random assignment,

159
00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:08.519
Bradley Scholten: identification of treatment groups,

160
00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:16.750
Bradley Scholten: and an indication that a comparison or measurement should be made at the end,

161
00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:24.410
Bradley Scholten: and they're just like their diagrams Have just that, just like random subjects. Next group

162
00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:25.900
Bradley Scholten: treatments.

163
00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:28.439
Bradley Scholten: Compare this at the end,

164
00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:35.849
Bradley Scholten: and then the same thing with block design, because it was like a first create it this way, now created with the block design.

165
00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:37.900
Bradley Scholten: So

166
00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:47.190
Bradley Scholten: I don't know. Do we want to tell them that it should be one or the other, or do we want to tell them? Do both?

167
00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:52.260
David Dobervich (he/him): Um,

168
00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:57.929
David Dobervich (he/him): I want to tell them do both, but maybe

169
00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:04.510
David Dobervich (he/him): a modified version of both. What do we actually Let's certainly have the diagram

170
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:07.569
David Dobervich (he/him): that covers assignments

171
00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:12.770
David Dobervich (he/him): that covers blocking

172
00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:15.740
David Dobervich (he/him): that covers

173
00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:17.710
David Dobervich (he/him): subjects.

174
00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:21.890
David Dobervich (he/him): So let's say they need to do.

175
00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:27.840
David Dobervich (he/him): Let's say they need to do uh

176
00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:31.290
David Dobervich (he/him): factor

177
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:40.860
David Dobervich (he/him): response or like factor plus levels and response, because that's identifying the explanatory and response variables.

178
00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:44.320
David Dobervich (he/him): They need to identify the treatment

179
00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:51.039
David Dobervich (he/him): and blinding. And then the diagram

180
00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:54.420
David Dobervich (he/him): which covers everything else.

181
00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:55.790
Bradley Scholten: Yeah.

182
00:16:56.770 --> 00:17:03.360
Bradley Scholten: Oh, wait, I guess. Actually, my question is, what's the difference between levels and treatments, because that's always the thing.

183
00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:10.530
Bradley Scholten: That's what I remember now is that that's always like the same as levels was always what we wrote for treatments.

184
00:17:11.069 --> 00:17:13.289
Bradley Scholten: What's the difference? Then?

185
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.140
David Dobervich (he/him): Okay,

186
00:17:22.569 --> 00:17:24.900
Bradley Scholten: let's see. Is your vocab.

187
00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:47.050
Bradley Scholten: Okay, A level? The specific value. Okay. Treatments: The controlled circumstances applied to experimental groups made of different levels of single factors or combinations of two or more factor levels.

188
00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:53.709
Bradley Scholten: Okay, the sense I have is the treatment represents each combination of factor levels.

189
00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:58.070
Bradley Scholten: Okay, so like this would be a scenario if let's say

190
00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:06.349
Bradley Scholten: so, We We wouldn't write same as levels in this scenario where it's like. Let's say we were interested in weight loss.

191
00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:09.710
Bradley Scholten: We have a pill.

192
00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:14.920
Bradley Scholten: We have exercise as our two sort of

193
00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:18.080
Bradley Scholten: explanatory variables.

194
00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:22.780
Bradley Scholten: And so we're gonna go like this group

195
00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:40.109
Bradley Scholten: is gonna just get the pill. No exercise. This other group is gonna get exercise note just and no pill. This group's gonna get neither of those. This group has to do both. That would be a scenario where we wouldn't just write treatment same as levels. Okay,

196
00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:43.760
that's what I was describing it last year, and

197
00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:47.139
Bradley Scholten: as I was saying it, I felt really good about it.

198
00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:51.939
Bradley Scholten: And then I never went back to confirm that I was saying actually the right things.

199
00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:55.820
Bradley Scholten: Okay,

200
00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:01.470
So

201
00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:05.340
Bradley Scholten: back to the visual.

202
00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:09.750
Bradley Scholten: So you don't you.

203
00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:15.140
Bradley Scholten: What of coning's? Sort of write ups and stuff like that? Do you like

204
00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:23.150
Bradley Scholten: for randomized blocks

205
00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:26.710
Bradley Scholten: like. Obviously there's an extra bullet point in here because of blocking.

206
00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:27.959
Bradley Scholten: But like,

207
00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:35.460
Bradley Scholten: if you were like, if this is your first shot at just sort of like. Oh, I want them to sort of write some stuff, and then I want them to

208
00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:38.450
Bradley Scholten: um draw a diagram like,

209
00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:42.249
Bradley Scholten: How would you organize it, or what makes sense to you.

210
00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:48.520
David Dobervich (he/him): Let me think about it.

211
00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:06.530
David Dobervich (he/him): So it follows a little bit what I did in my three D. One notes,

212
00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:13.440
David Dobervich (he/him): so I would have them explicitly right the population of interest,

213
00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:20.840
David Dobervich (he/him): and then indicate how the subjects or the experimental units were sampled from the population of interest,

214
00:20:21.370 --> 00:20:27.960
David Dobervich (he/him): which is something that the block diagram leaves out. The block diagram just starts with. We have one hundred and three Ap. St. Students,

215
00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:35.200
David Dobervich (he/him): whereas I would start with like population of interest. Ap stats, students,

216
00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:42.409
David Dobervich (he/him): you know, like like in like worldwide ap St. Students, or like American ap stats, students or something.

217
00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:46.229
David Dobervich (he/him): And then I would indicate, like

218
00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:50.360
David Dobervich (he/him): simple random sample or convenient sample, or whatever

219
00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:55.789
David Dobervich (he/him): that gives you your one hundred and three Ap. St. Students. So for us it's a convenient sample.

220
00:20:56.810 --> 00:21:00.320
David Dobervich (he/him): Assuming these are like our students. Um,

221
00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:05.550
David Dobervich (he/him): you know, just to be like fully explicit about what's going on here. Um,

222
00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:10.759
David Dobervich (he/him): Then I like for blocking. I like. I like this indication of the two blocks. That's fine.

223
00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:13.280
David Dobervich (he/him): Um!

224
00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:19.270
David Dobervich (he/him): I like this indication of how are we doing the random assignment

225
00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:21.560
David Dobervich (he/him): in uh to the treatments?

226
00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:25.450
David Dobervich (he/him): I think it would be nice

227
00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:34.940
David Dobervich (he/him): to visually indicate, like, what's the control, and what are the kind of test ones

228
00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:47.050
Bradley Scholten: this bracketing for showing how the comparison happens?

229
00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:52.660
Bradley Scholten: Is there any benefit to like having them?

230
00:21:53.330 --> 00:22:11.719
Bradley Scholten: Maybe in the beginning stating what type of design they're doing before jumping in? Because i'm noticing like, and the bullet points over here. Blocking comes like the fifth one down, but that feels like something that you need to think about. I know it says up here like create a randomized block design. So it's kind of given,

231
00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:16.869
Bradley Scholten: but it feels like one of those things Works like you should be thinking about. That, actually, initially, is like,

232
00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:19.680
Bradley Scholten: Is there a reason to block here?

233
00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:21.290
Bradley Scholten: And why?

234
00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:23.510
David Dobervich (he/him): Yeah, like that?

235
00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:30.610
Bradley Scholten: Uh, let me write this down

236
00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:46.479
David Dobervich (he/him): so initially, like type of study. And If the type of study is experiment, then it's like like type of experiment, or like experimental design type.

237
00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:51.310
David Dobervich (he/him): Um,

238
00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:59.829
David Dobervich (he/him): let's have them List factor, which is explanatory variable

239
00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:02.110
David Dobervich (he/him): and response,

240
00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:12.279
David Dobervich (he/him): and maybe levels also there,

241
00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:24.020
Bradley Scholten: Apparently you're not missing much at your your schoology training

242
00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:29.560
uh the schoology leads aren't even there right now.

243
00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:32.710
David Dobervich (he/him): I didn't even know that was happening.

244
00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:37.050
Bradley Scholten: They canceled the meeting

245
00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:48.520
Bradley Scholten: uh terra text Texas last night, and was like, Oh, man, like you guys are so lucky you're out. Let me get this stupid training. We're like what?

246
00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:04.240
David Dobervich (he/him): All right?

247
00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:12.020
David Dobervich (he/him): Yeah. So So they really The only difference in what we've said so far is, let's have the first thing be the type of study.

248
00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:13.200
Bradley Scholten: Yeah,

249
00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:29.420
David Dobervich (he/him): Okay.

250
00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:38.010
Bradley Scholten: Video: three point three is ninety, six uploaded.

251
00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:46.159
Bradley Scholten: So it should be done soon.

252
00:24:57.810 --> 00:24:59.350
David Dobervich (he/him): And I mean, like

253
00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:06.879
David Dobervich (he/him): all of this, skips over like what is the actual experimental protocol?

254
00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:10.810
David Dobervich (he/him): But they won't. They Won't usually be writing that down.

255
00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:13.379
Bradley Scholten: What do you mean by that.

256
00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:24.569
But I just wanted to say out loud that we're skipping that.

257
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:27.689
Bradley Scholten: What do you mean by the experimental protocol? What do you

258
00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:34.200
David Dobervich (he/him): so like in my example where it was like we were. We have a hair growth formula.

259
00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:45.640
David Dobervich (he/him): You can't just send your test group home and be like. Use This you have to, you know, give enough precision that your test subjects are using it in the same way.

260
00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:52.690
Bradley Scholten: Yeah, there is a lot of yeah. We send students home to do these problems, like,

261
00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:54.770
Bradley Scholten: you know,

262
00:25:56.410 --> 00:25:57.780
Bradley Scholten: like one?

263
00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:01.620
Bradley Scholten: Are they actually going to do it? And then to

264
00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:06.659
Bradley Scholten: what does it mean to do? A problem, you know, like there's different levels of what students know.

265
00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:16.410
Bradley Scholten: Right? You're like study for thirty minutes, and some students study with their phone and stuff. You can study without their phone.

266
00:26:17.550 --> 00:26:19.440
Bradley Scholten: Okay? Um:

267
00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:21.160
Well,

268
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.180
Bradley Scholten: I feel pretty good.

269
00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:29.070
Bradley Scholten: Uh, can you check to see if the video

270
00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:31.640
Bradley Scholten: is

271
00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:42.160
Bradley Scholten: good Now it says that it's synced. But Then there's this other one with a bunch of weird suffix letters and dashes that says it's still uploading, so

272
00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:51.600
David Dobervich (he/him): I do not see an uploaded one yet. Right. We've got the suffix one,

273
00:26:52.450 --> 00:27:04.250
Bradley Scholten: but you don't see one that doesn't have the suffix.

274
00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:22.900
Bradley Scholten: All right. Let me see if I can. Is it? Are we done enough that I can go to the restroom.

275
00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:31.869
Bradley Scholten: What inspiration I get to do! The next video notes for the block design

276
00:27:33.310 --> 00:27:37.260
Bradley Scholten: sounds good.
